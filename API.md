# FlameChess — API Contract

**Status:** Phase 7 (extras). Adds reconnect/abandon grace, rematch, in-game chat (persisted), and spectating (watch-by-link + live-games lobby) on top of Phase 5 persistence/ratings and Phase 6 challenges.
**Source of truth:** generated from `internal/wire/wire.go` + `internal/httpapi/router.go` + `internal/httpapi/auth.go` + `internal/ws/ws.go`.

This is the contract a frontend / test client builds against. Sections marked **[live]** are implemented and stable now. Sections marked **[deferred]** are from the design spec (§6) but **not** served yet — do not build against them.

## Auth & sessions

Identity is carried by an HMAC-signed cookie named **`fc_session`** (`HttpOnly`, `Path=/`, `SameSite=Lax`, `Secure` in production). The `/ws` upgrade and `GET /api/me` read it; there is no bearer-token / header auth.

The signed payload (after verify) is an `Identity`:

```json
{ "uid": "u-1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b", "email": "alice@flame.edu.in", "name": "Alice" }
```

- `uid` — the user's `users.id` **UUID**. As of Phase 5 the server upserts a `users` row at login (Google **and** dev-login) and puts that UUID in the cookie, so the cookie uid *is* the persistent user id. ⚠️ **Re-login required after the Phase 5 deploy:** old `u-…` cookies no longer resolve to a user and yield `401` on `GET /api/me`.
- `email` — present for Google logins; for dev-login it is the synthetic `<name>@dev.local` (dev accounts are persisted and rated like any other).
- `name` — display name (sourced from the DB, so a `PATCH /api/me` rename is reflected here after the cookie is re-signed).

### Google OAuth **[live]**

Production login. Gated to verified Flame University accounts: the email must be verified **and** end with `@<ALLOWED_EMAIL_SUFFIX>` (default `flame.edu.in`). These routes are registered only when `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`/`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`/`GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URL` are configured.

- **`GET /auth/google/login`** — sets a short-lived `fc_oauth_state` cookie and `302`-redirects to Google's consent screen.
- **`GET /auth/google/callback`** — Google redirects here with `code` + `state`. The server validates `state` against the cookie (mismatch/missing → `400`), exchanges the code, and applies the suffix gate:
  - **allowed** → sets the `fc_session` cookie and `302`-redirects to `APP_REDIRECT_URL` (default `/`).
  - **rejected** (unverified or non-Flame email) → `403` with a minimal "Flame accounts only" HTML page.

### `POST /auth/logout` **[live]**

Clears the `fc_session` cookie (expired `Set-Cookie`). Returns `204`. Afterwards `GET /api/me` is `401` and the `/ws` upgrade is `401`.

### `POST /auth/dev-login` **[live, dev only]**

Mints a session cookie for a display name **without Google**. Gated by `DEV_LOGIN` (default `true`); production runs `DEV_LOGIN=false`, which removes this route (`404`) and requires the Google flow. This is the path the local frontend uses while developing.

- **Body:** form-encoded, field `name` (defaults to `anon` if omitted).
- **Response:** sets the `fc_session` cookie and returns the `Identity` JSON above.

```bash
curl -i -X POST -d 'name=Alice' http://localhost:8080/auth/dev-login
# Set-Cookie: fc_session=<payload>.<hmac>; Path=/; HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax
```

Browser flow: `POST /auth/dev-login` (same origin so the cookie sticks) → open the WebSocket; the cookie rides along automatically.

---

## REST

### `GET /healthz` **[live]**

Liveness. `200` with `{ "status": "ok" }`.

### `GET /api/me` **[live]**

Returns the caller's profile + live ratings. `display_name`/`email` are read from the DB (not the cookie), so a rename is reflected immediately. No body required.

- **`200`** with JSON:
  ```json
  {
    "uid": "1f2e...-uuid",
    "email": "alice@flame.edu.in",
    "display_name": "Alice",
    "ratings": {
      "bullet": { "rating": 800, "games_played": 0 },
      "blitz":  { "rating": 812, "games_played": 3 },
      "rapid":  { "rating": 800, "games_played": 0 }
    }
  }
  ```
- **`401`** if the cookie is missing, fails verification, **or** the uid no longer resolves to a user (stale pre-Phase-5 cookie → re-login).

```bash
curl -i --cookie 'fc_session=<payload>.<hmac>' http://localhost:8080/api/me
```

### `PATCH /api/me` **[live]**

Durably change the display name. Cookie-authenticated.

- **Body:** JSON `{ "display_name": "NewName" }`. Validated: trimmed length 1–30, characters limited to letters, digits, space, `_`, `-`, `.`.
- **`200`** → name updated; the server **re-signs the `fc_session` cookie** (so the WebSocket layer sees the new name without a re-login) and returns the same body as `GET /api/me`.
- **`400`** invalid/empty name. **`409`** the name is already taken (unique constraint). **`401`** no/invalid cookie.

```bash
curl -i -X PATCH --cookie 'fc_session=<payload>.<hmac>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"display_name":"Alice2"}' \
  http://localhost:8080/api/me
```

### `GET /api/leaderboard?category=blitz&limit=50` **[live]**

Top players for a category, by rating descending. Cookie-authenticated.

- **Query:** `category` ∈ {`bullet`,`blitz`,`rapid`} (default `blitz`; unknown values fall back to `blitz`); `limit` default `50`, max `200`.
- **`200`** with JSON array `[{ "rank": 1, "display_name": "...", "rating": 1100, "games_played": 8 }, ...]`. **`401`** if unauthenticated.

### `GET /api/games?limit=50` **[live]**

The caller's own finished-game history, newest first. Cookie-authenticated.

- **Query:** `limit` default `50`, max `200`.
- **`200`** with JSON array of:
  ```json
  {
    "id": "game-uuid",
    "opponent": "Bob",
    "color": "white",
    "result": "1-0",
    "reason": "checkmate",
    "category": "blitz",
    "rating_before": 800,
    "rating_after": 816,
    "ended_at": "2026-06-15T12:00:00Z"
  }
  ```
- **`401`** if unauthenticated.

### `GET /api/games/{id}` **[Phase 7 — live]**

Single-game detail plus its persisted chat (also the basis for replay later). Cookie-authenticated. Works for active and finished games.

- **`200`** with JSON:
  ```json
  {
    "game": {
      "id": "game-uuid", "white_id": "...", "black_id": "...",
      "category": "blitz", "status": "finished", "result": "1-0",
      "reason": "checkmate", "pgn": "1. e4 e5 ...",
      "started_at": "2026-06-18T12:00:00Z", "ended_at": "2026-06-18T12:09:00Z"
    },
    "messages": [
      { "sender_id": "...", "sender_name": "Alice", "body": "gg", "ts": 1718712000000 }
    ]
  }
  ```
  `ts` is unix **milliseconds**. `messages` is ordered oldest-first.
- **`404`** unknown id. **`401`** if unauthenticated.

### `GET /api/games/live` **[Phase 7 — live]**

The live-games lobby list (for initial load / refresh without waiting for the next `games.live` broadcast). Cookie-authenticated.

- **`200`** with JSON `{ "games": [{ "game_id": "...", "white": "Alice", "black": "Bob", "category": "blitz", "base": 300, "increment": 0 }] }`. **`401`** if unauthenticated.

---

## `POST /api/challenges` **[Phase 6 — live]**

Create a **shareable challenge link**. Cookie-authenticated. The returned `url` embeds a single-use token (`?c=<token>`); the first authenticated visitor to open it is paired with the creator into a game (see `challenge.accept` below).

- **Body:** `{ "base": <int seconds>, "increment": <int seconds> }`
- **`200`:**
  ```json
  { "token": "abc123", "url": "https://host/?c=abc123" }
  ```
  `url` scheme follows `X-Forwarded-Proto` (else the request's TLS state); host follows the request `Host`.
- **`401`** if unauthenticated.

Direct (player-to-player) challenges do **not** use this endpoint — they go over the WebSocket via `challenge.create_direct`.

---

## WebSocket — `GET /ws` **[Phase 3 — live]**

Cookie-authenticated on upgrade. Missing or invalid `fc_session` → **`401 Unauthorized`** (no upgrade). Origin is not checked in dev (`InsecureSkipVerify`), so a client on a different port can connect.

All frames are **text** JSON with a `type` discriminator: `{ "type": "...", ...fields }`. Decode `type` first, then the typed struct.

### Server invariant

The server only ever emits authoritative state (real FEN + real clock ms). The client *proposes* a `move` and receives either a new `game.state` or an `error` — never a locally-applied result. Desync and protocol cheating are impossible by construction.

---

### Client → server

| `type` | Fields | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `queue.join` | `category` (string), `base` (int, seconds), `increment` (int, seconds) | Join the quick-match pool. Pairing is FIFO within an **exact `(base, increment)`** pool. **`category` is currently informational** — the server derives the real category from `base` and does not pool on it. Joining while already queued or in a game is ignored. |
| `queue.leave` | — | Leave the pool. |
| `move` | `game_id` (string), `uci` (string, e.g. `"e2e4"`, `"e7e8q"`) | Propose a move. `game_id` must match your active game. |
| `resign` | `game_id` (string) | Resign the active game. |
| `draw.offer` | `game_id` (string) | Offer a draw to the opponent. |
| `draw.respond` | `game_id` (string), `accept` (bool) | Respond to a pending offer. `accept:true` ends the game `1/2-1/2`; `false` clears the offer and play continues. |
| `ping` | — | Liveness; server replies `pong`. |
| `challenge.create_direct` | `opponent_id` (string uid), `base` (int), `increment` (int) | **[Phase 6]** Directly challenge a specific online user. Server validates and, on success, sends them `challenge.incoming` and acks you with `challenge.created`. |
| `challenge.accept` | `token` (string) | **[Phase 6]** Accept a challenge (direct or link). On success a `game.start` arrives for both players. Token is single-use. |
| `challenge.decline` | `token` (string) | **[Phase 6]** Decline a direct challenge you received; the creator gets `challenge.declined`. |
| `challenge.cancel` | `token` (string) | **[Phase 6]** Cancel a challenge you created; a direct target gets `challenge.gone`. |
| `rematch.offer` | `game_id` (string, the just-finished game) | **[Phase 7]** Offer a rematch to your opponent from the finished game. If they already offered, the rematch starts immediately. Offers expire after `REMATCH_TTL_SECONDS` (default 60). |
| `rematch.respond` | `game_id` (string), `accept` (bool) | **[Phase 7]** Respond to a `rematch.offered`. Accept → a `game.start` arrives for both with **swapped colors**; decline → offerer gets `rematch.declined`. |
| `chat.send` | `game_id` (string), `text` (string) | **[Phase 7]** Send an in-game chat message. **Players only** (spectators are read-only). Empty/whitespace dropped; capped at 500 runes (truncated). Relayed to both players + spectators as `chat.msg` and persisted. |
| `spectate.join` | `game_id` (string) | **[Phase 7]** Start watching a live game. Server replies with a `game.start` snapshot (`color:"spectator"`) then live `game.state`/`game.over`/`chat.msg`. |
| `spectate.leave` | — | **[Phase 7]** Stop watching the current game. |

Example:

```json
{ "type": "queue.join", "category": "blitz", "base": 300, "increment": 0 }
{ "type": "move", "game_id": "g1", "uci": "e2e4" }
{ "type": "draw.respond", "game_id": "g1", "accept": true }
```

### Server → client

| `type` | Fields | When |
|---|---|---|
| `online.count` | `n` (int) | Broadcast to everyone on every register/unregister. |
| `online.list` | `users` (array of `{uid, name}`) | **[Phase 6]** Live roster of connected users, broadcast alongside `online.count`. Drives the lobby's online-players panel; the client filters out its own `uid`. |
| `queue.waiting` | — | You joined a pool with no waiting opponent; you're parked. |
| `game.start` | `game_id`, `color` (`"white"`/`"black"`), `opponent` (display name), `clocks` (`{white_ms,black_ms}`), `fen` | A match was made. Colors are random; both players receive opposite colors and the same `game_id`. |
| `game.state` | `game_id`, `fen`, `last_move` (UCI), `white_ms`, `black_ms`, `turn` (`"white"`/`"black"`) | After every accepted move. Authoritative board + clocks. |
| `game.over` | `game_id`, `result` (`"1-0"`/`"0-1"`/`"1/2-1/2"`), `reason`, `ratings` (optional) | Terminal transition. For **rated** games `ratings` carries per-color before/after/delta (see below); it is **omitted** for aborted / 0-move games. |
| `draw.offered` | `game_id`, `from` (offerer's `uid`) | Opponent offered a draw. |
| `challenge.incoming` | `token`, `from` (uid), `from_name` (display name), `base`, `increment`, `category` | **[Phase 6]** Someone directly challenged you. Show an Accept/Decline prompt. |
| `challenge.created` | `token`, `url` (empty for direct) | **[Phase 6]** Ack that your challenge was registered. |
| `challenge.declined` | `token` | **[Phase 6]** Your direct challenge was declined (or the target went offline). |
| `challenge.gone` | `token` | **[Phase 6]** A challenge you received was withdrawn (creator cancelled or disconnected). Remove its prompt. |
| `opponent.disconnected` | `color` (`"white"`/`"black"`), `grace_seconds` (int) | **[Phase 7]** Your opponent dropped. Their clock **keeps running**; if they don't return within `grace_seconds` the game ends `abandoned`. Also sent to spectators. |
| `opponent.reconnected` | `color` | **[Phase 7]** The dropped player came back; play continues. Also sent to spectators. |
| `rematch.offered` | `game_id`, `from` (uid), `from_name` | **[Phase 7]** Your opponent offered a rematch on the finished game. Show an Accept/Decline prompt. |
| `rematch.declined` | `game_id` | **[Phase 7]** Your rematch offer was declined, or the other player left / entered another game. Clear the prompt. |
| `chat.msg` | `game_id`, `from` (uid), `from_name`, `text`, `ts` (unix millis) | **[Phase 7]** A chat message in your game. Delivered to both players and all spectators. |
| `games.live` | `games` (array of `{game_id, white, black, category, base, increment}`) | **[Phase 7]** The live-games lobby. Sent to a connection on register, and broadcast to everyone when a game starts or ends. |
| `pong` | — | Reply to `ping`. |
| `error` | `code`, `msg` | A request was rejected; game state is untouched. |

**Reconnect & spectator snapshots reuse `game.start`.** On reconnect, the rejoining player gets a `game.start` with their real `color` (plus live `clocks`) followed by the current `game.state`. A spectator's join snapshot is a `game.start` with `color:"spectator"` carrying both player names in extra `white`/`black` fields, followed by the current `game.state`.

`game.over.reason` is one of:
`checkmate`, `stalemate`, `insufficient`, `threefold`, `fifty_move`, `resign`, `draw_agreed`, `timeout`, `abandoned` (**[Phase 7]** opponent disconnected past the grace window).

The optional `ratings` block (rated games only) carries the Elo change for both colors; each client reads its own color (known from `game.start`):

```json
{ "ratings": {
    "white": { "before": 800, "after": 816, "delta": 16 },
    "black": { "before": 800, "after": 784, "delta": -16 }
} }
```

Ratings use standard Elo per category (start 800; `K=40` for the first 30 games, `K=20` after). Aborted / 0-move games do not change ratings and omit the block entirely.

Example:

```json
{ "type": "game.start", "game_id": "g1", "color": "white",
  "opponent": "Bob", "clocks": { "white_ms": 300000, "black_ms": 300000 },
  "fen": "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1" }

{ "type": "game.state", "game_id": "g1",
  "fen": "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1",
  "last_move": "e2e4", "white_ms": 298731, "black_ms": 300000, "turn": "black" }

{ "type": "game.over", "game_id": "g1", "result": "0-1", "reason": "checkmate",
  "ratings": { "white": { "before": 800, "after": 784, "delta": -16 },
               "black": { "before": 800, "after": 816, "delta": 16 } } }
```

### Error codes

| `code` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `bad_message` | Malformed frame, unknown `type`, or undecodable fields. The read pump survives — the connection stays open. |
| `illegal_move` | Move is not legal in the current position. |
| `not_your_turn` | It's the opponent's turn. |
| `not_in_game` | You sent an in-game action but aren't in a game. |
| `game_not_active` | Action against a finished game. |
| `unknown_game` | `game_id` doesn't match your active game. |
| `unknown_challenge` | **[Phase 6]** Token is missing, already used, or not addressed to you. |
| `challenge_self` | **[Phase 6]** You tried to challenge or accept your own challenge. |
| `busy` | **[Phase 6]** One of the two players is already in a game. |
| `opponent_offline` | **[Phase 6]** The challenge target (or creator, at accept time) is not connected. |
| `unknown_game` | **[Phase 7]** Also used by `spectate.join` when the game isn't live (or you're a player in it). |
| `rematch_unavailable` | **[Phase 7]** The rematch slot expired, doesn't exist, the other player is offline, or there's nothing to respond to. |

---

## Behavior the client must handle (Phase 3)

- **Single active socket per user.** A second `/ws` connection for the same `uid` closes the older one (newest wins). `online.count` is unchanged across the swap.
- **Disconnect mid-game does NOT end the game.** The clock keeps running. **[Phase 7]** the opponent gets `opponent.disconnected {grace_seconds}`; if you reconnect within the grace window (`RECONNECT_GRACE_SECONDS`, default 30) your new socket re-attaches and gets a `game.start`+`game.state` snapshot, and the opponent gets `opponent.reconnected`. Otherwise the game ends `abandoned` (you lose). You can still also lose on the flag (`reason: "timeout"`) if the clock runs out first.
- **Clocks are wall-clock authoritative.** Trust `white_ms`/`black_ms` from `game.state`; don't compute results client-side.
- **One game per user at a time** in the quick-match flow.

---

## Not yet live (don't build against these yet)

- Full move-by-move **replay** UI (Phase 8). The data is available now via `GET /api/games/{id}` (PGN + chat).

---

## Frontend handoff notes

- **Local dev login:** the frontend authenticates via `POST /auth/dev-login?name=X` (no Google needed) while `DEV_LOGIN=true`. **Production** uses the Google flow (`GET /auth/google/login`); dev-login is `404` there.
- **Cross-origin (CORS):** set `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to a comma-separated allowlist of frontend origins (e.g. `https://app.flame.edu.in,http://localhost:5173`). When set, the server returns credentialed CORS headers (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` echoed per-request, `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`, preflight `OPTIONS` → `204`) and switches auth cookies to **`SameSite=None; Secure`** so the browser sends them on cross-site requests. From the frontend, **all** REST/auth calls must use `credentials: "include"` (e.g. `fetch(url, { credentials: "include" })`).
- **HTTPS required for cross-origin:** `SameSite=None` cookies must be `Secure`, so a cross-origin frontend must talk to the server over **HTTPS** (browsers reject `SameSite=None` non-Secure cookies). For plain `http://localhost` development, prefer same-origin or serve over TLS.
- **Same origin (no CORS):** if `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is empty, no CORS headers are sent and cookies stay `SameSite=Lax` — serve the frontend from the **same origin** as the Go server. (The `/ws` upgrade does not check Origin, so the socket itself works cross-port regardless — but `GET /api/me` and the auth cookie follow the policy above.)
- **Who am I:** call `GET /api/me` on load; `401` means "not logged in" → send the user to dev-login (local) or `GET /auth/google/login` (prod).
